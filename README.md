# Modular Extensions 🧩

This repository explores potential modular extensions of the **Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN)** to enhance its capabilities across various domains.

## Starting Point: Healthcare 🏥

We begin with the healthcare sector — enabling **self-sovereign, decentralized healthcare setups** designed for:

- Communities without existing infrastructure 🌍  
- Regions seeking affordable, transparent alternatives 💡  
- Organizations aiming to build more scalable and sustainable health systems ⚙️  

This architecture provides a **low-cost, modular foundation** for more inclusive and resilient healthcare models.

To showcase its potential, we provide an example implementation through a **Decentralized Health Intelligence Network (DHIN)** — demonstrating how DIN can support privacy-preserving collaboration, efficient data aggregation, and improved participation across healthcare ecosystems.

Stay tuned as we expand into additional use cases and modular integrations 🚀
